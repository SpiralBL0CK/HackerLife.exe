Write up about an exploit  chain failed to be fully weaponised and experience when trying to tryin to sell your first nday.

So what this story about ? Our quote on qute "life experience in 2025 as young security researcher trying to make in in a ever changing and compilated environment". When 2025 hit some even happened in my life which propmted me to try to somehow make some cash. Unf. to this day this was never the case since i faile misserably as you'll see. Such the team decided to try to utilize our skills. We were contacted by a person on a ssn. When this person reach us they presented themselves as an upcoming start-up which was in cybersecurity from a part of the world this country being part of mnna, so a nato friend(tring not to leave to many details about this person as they are irrelevant anyway). They reached us because they were looking for a person to help imrpove their product a metasploit preium framework sorts of, so basically they were in need of ndays for their framework. To which we replyed happly that we will help again a certain ammount of money.(again irrelevant as still the transaction never came to be). Such we propposed a series of potentials cve we tought we could use to produce an exploit in a month and a-half. you can take a look at the proposed product here.
